Superstore Discounted Sales Analysis

• Performed an exploratory analysis for around 10000 superstore discount data to review the company discount policy. 

• Explored data with visualization and observed the firm made profits with discounts lower than 20% while lost with beyond 20% discounts.

• Revealed the high deduction on commodities prices caused the loss of the corporate, losing $156K with an average 45% discount.

• Architected a Tableau story to guide the stakeholders to stop carrying out the high discounted policy on Tables, Binders, and Machines since the 3 categories accounted for over 50% loss of the company.
